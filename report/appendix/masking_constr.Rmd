# Masking effect (CATO, GUNNEXP2)

Studies associated with two datasets (CATO, GUNNEXP2) investigated to what extent masking the previously written text affects keystroke behaviour. The mixture model results for the effect of masking is shown in Table \ref{tab:maskingeffect}. There was some evidence for longer before-sentence hesitation durations when the text was masked in non-dyslexic writers. Evidence for all other comparisons was negligible.
