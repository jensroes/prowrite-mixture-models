# Masking effect (CATO, GE2)

Studies associated with the CATO and GE2 datasets investigated to what extent hiding (masking) previously written text from the reader affects keystroke behaviour. Mixture model results for the masking effect are shown in Table \ref{tab:maskingeffect}. There is some evidence that when the text was masked dylexic writers hesitated longer before starting to type sentences. Evidence for all other comparisons was negligible.
