## L2 effect (SPL2)

For the SPL2 data (only the `_^[shift]` sentence-transitions) we calculated the L2 effect (i.e. the difference between writing in L2 and L1). The results can be found in Table \ref{tab:l2effect}. The results show longer keystrokes and more pauses across all transition locations. However, the pause duration only differed at before-word locations, not at within-word or before-sentence transition locations.
